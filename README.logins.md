A login *must* have recovery addresses (which does not allow login).
A login *may* have a verified email / phone addresses (which does allow login).

The recovery address *may* be tested
The verified address *must* be tested
Any verified address *must* be allowed for recovery

Thought Dump:

Could a username be used as a recovery address? (i.e. a peer in the system can recover your login?)
(meaning that user may be sent a push / other notification or that any backup or verified addresses of that user may
be used)?
A username would needs be verified for anything other than notifications.
